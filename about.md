# About Idaho's Women of Influence

Idaho's Women of Influence is meant to correct an imbalance in the preserved historical data on women's contribution to Idaho history. Both a database of important women in the history of the state of Idaho and the home for a peer-reviewed scholarly journal on the same topic, Idaho's Women of Influence is open to all women connected to Idaho by birth, residence, work, or any other significant factor whose positive efforts and accomplishments contributed significantly to the quality of life in their community, the state, or the world.
