Some say the Union Pacific Railroad made Sun Valley an international destination, but a lot of old timers there say it was really their employee, Dorice Taylor, whose vision, energy and promotional work made everything happen. A graduate of Smith College and a teacher, Dorice and her husband took many trips to Sun Valley starting in 1937 and after World War II she became its director of public relations where she kept Sun Valley connected with the rest of the skiing world. <br><br> Dorice was a 1971 recipient of the ski writers' "Golden Quill" award. Additionally she published <em>Sun Valley</em>, a memoir, in her 80s and was inducted into the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame in 1984.
