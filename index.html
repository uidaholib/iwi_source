Idaho's Women of Influence is a project meant to correct an imbalance in the preserved historical data on women's contributions to Idaho history made up of two parts: a contribution-based database of influential women and a peer-reviewed journal of Idaho women's history. 
It is open to women connected to Idaho by birth, residence, work, or any other significant factor, whose positive efforts and accomplishments contributed significantly to quality of life in their community, the state or the world.
