A resident of rural north Idaho, Christine Holbert is the founding director of Lost Horse Press, an independent press that publishes poetry and contemporary literature. Christine earned her publishing degree from Eastern Washington University in 1998 and founded the Press in the same year. In addition to running the Press, Holbert is dedicated to contributing to the community. <br><br> She serves on the board of the Idaho Center for the Book, organizes creative writing workshops, an annual writing conference for adults, literary readings, and an annual book contest—The Idaho Prize for Poetry—to promote the literary arts in Idaho and nationally. In 2001, Lost Horse Press and the East Bonner County Library introduced a program—Young Writers of the Lost Horse—to help children in elementary through high school strengthen their writing skills and heighten their interest in writing. These workshops are provided at no charge to Bonner County students, and are designed to give children from grades 5 through 12 a fresh perspective on the process and pleasure of writing.
