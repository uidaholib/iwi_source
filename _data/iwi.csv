She gave over 140 public lectures in Idaho from 1876 to 1895, and made a historic 6,000 word lecture to Idaho's statehood planning convention in 1880. In 1887 she began working full-time in Idaho towards equality. Idaho voted in 1896 to give women the vote because of Abigail's efforts.","Abigail emigrated with her family from Illinois on the Oregon Trail in 1852. After arriving in the Willamette Valley, Abigail became a teacher in Eola and in 1853 married Benjamin Charles Duniway. Abigail also wrote and published a novel, <em>Captain Grey's Company</em>, in 1859, the first book commercially published in Oregon. <br><br> The Duniways were farmers until Benjamin became permanently disabled in an accident, making Abigail the breadwinner for their six children. At first she opened and managed a small boarding school, then taught private school in Albany, then opened a millinery and notions shop. It was at the millinery and notions shop that Abigail became enraged by the mistreatment of her married patrons. Encouraged by her husband, she moved to Portland in 1871 to found <em>The New Northwest</em>, a weekly newspaper devoted to women's rights, including suffrage. The first issue was published on May 5, 1871 and she served as editor until she closed the paper in 1887. <br><br> From 1887 to 1895 Abigail lived in Idaho, working for the women's suffrage movement.

It was an unpopular choice at the time, as the Lemhi and Salmon River valleys had always been cattle country. Despite opposition, however, her venture was a success. By 1910, the family moved out of their old log cabin into a fine six-bedroom stone house, complete with electric lights and indoor plumbing. By the 1930s, her sheep operation had spread over 2,500 acres of range, with 5,000 sheep. <br><br> Emma's forceful personality led her to politics in 1930.

Born in Washington, D.C., her family settled in Moscow, Idaho in the early 1890s. After graduating with a Bachelor of Science, Jennie married George Smith and later had four children. Sadly, her son Berthol, who was the second African-American to enroll at the University of Idaho, died in 1919 while still a student.","Jennie Eva Hughes, Class of 1899, was the first African-American to graduate from the University of Idaho. Jennie's family had travelled west from Washington, D.C. to Idaho, where according to the Census of 1890, there were only 201 African-Americans in the entire state. Although there is no doubt the family encountered prejudice of some sort, it is known that the family was well regarded in Moscow. Although some western states restricted the enrolment of black students in public schools, Jennie had not been prohibited from attending Moscow's public schools and she graduated from Moscow High School in 1895. <br><br> As a student at the University of Idaho, according to historian Keith Petersen in <em>This Crested Hill: An Illustrated History of the University of Idaho</em>, Jennie “accumulated an admirable academic record.” She won the prestigious Watkins Medal for Oratory in 1898, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree, one of seven students in the Class of 1899. In a speech to her classmates at the time of their graduation, Jennie urged them to “occupy positions of usefulness.” After college, Jennie met and married George Augustus Smith and the two relocated to Wardner, Idaho where George worked as a miner. <br><br> Despite the success George enjoyed in the Silver Valley, Jennie and George and their four children moved to Spokane, Washington in 1912 in part because Jennie did not consider the rough-and-tumble atmosphere of the mining towns ""a suitable place to raise children."" Jennie's son Berthol was the second African-American student to enroll in the University of Idaho, but sadly died in 1919 while still a student. Another son, Leonard, earned a law degree and practiced as an attorney in Spokane while her youngest son graduated from Washington State University in 1935 with a degree in Electrical Engineering. <br><br> Because Jennie left neither letters nor a diary, it is not known if Jennie herself believed her life had been one of usefulness.

Lana starred opposite Clark Gable in four films, and was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in the 1957 film <em>Peyton Place</em>.","Born in Wallace, Idaho as the only daugher to teenaged parents, Lana moved to San Francisco when her family fell on hard times. Soon after moving, her parents separated and her father was killed in an unsolved murder-robbery in 1930. Her mother developed health problems and moved, with 10 year old Lana, to Los Angeles in 1931. Her mother was very poor during this time, and worked 80 hours a week as a beautician to support their small family. <br><br> Lana Turner's discovery in a Hollywood drug store is show-business legend. At 16, Lana was skipping class to buy a soda at a malt shop when she was spotted by William R. Wilkerson, publisher of the Hollywood Reporter. Wilkerson referred her to the talent agent Zeppo Marx, who's agency immediately signed her on and cast her in her first film, <em>They Won't Forget</em> in 1937. It was in a scene in <em>They Won't Forget</em> that Lana earned the nickname ""the Sweater Girl,"" which Lana detested throughout her career. In 1937, she signed a contract with Metro-Goldwin-Mayer for $100 a week and graduated from high school between filming. Her next starring role was opposite Mickey Rooney in the film <em>Love Finds Andy Hardy</em> in 1938. <br><br> Turner went on to star in many youth-oriented films in the late 1930s and early 1940s.

She also starred opposite Clark Gable in four films and had a B-17 Flying Fortress named after her.

She appeared in the 1941 horror film <em>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em>, and her reputation as a glamorous femme fatale was enhanced by her performance in the film noir <em>The Postman Always Rings Twice</em> (1946). Her popularity continued through the 1950s, in such films as <em>The Bad and the Beautiful</em> (1952) and <em>Peyton Place</em> (1957), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. <br><br> Media controversy surrounded Turner in 1958 when her daughter, Cheryl Crane, stabbed Turner's lover Johnny Stompanato to death in their Beverly Hills home - later classified as self-defense.

She was also noted for her insistence on being called 'Congressman Chenoweth' instead of 'Congresswoman Chenoweth.' <br><br> In 1995 Helen voiced concern that armed federal agents were landing black helicopters on Idaho ranchers' property to enforce the Endangered Species Act, in line with a longstanding conspiracy theory. The Los Angeles Times editorialized that during the campaign she gained national attention by ""holding 'endangered salmon bakes' during fundraisers, serving canned salmon to ridicule the listing of Idaho salmon as an endangered species."" She was quoted as saying in response, ""It's the white, Anglo-Saxon male that's endangered today."" Chenoweth remained a controversial and polarizing figure in Idaho politics throughout her career. <br><br> Congressman Chenoweth was also a strong critic of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal and was one of the first to call for his resignation over the affair, although she admitted that she had carried on a six-year illicit romance with a married rancher in the 1980s. Chenoweth was re-elected twice and honored her pledge to only serve three terms.
